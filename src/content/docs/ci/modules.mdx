I am using [GitHub Actions] to implement the CI/CD workflows. I made
this decision partly because I know Ebb already use it. However, I also
like it and I have some experience using it.

The approach I have had success with in the past is to build
components that encapsulate the operations involved in delivering
software. This helps with standardization and DRY-ness but that's not
the primary goal - the important thing is that it improves both the
speed and quality of development.
