  Giving OpenTofu a spin
</Card>

---

I am using [OpenTofu] to manage infrastructure in AWS. I have a lot of
experience using [Terraform] but decided to give [OpenTofu] a go. If
you don't already know, [OpenTofu] is a fork of [Terraform] that was
created by [Terraform] contributors after Terraform changed their
licensing to be less permissive.
