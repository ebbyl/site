  OpenID Connect for secure access between GitHub and AWS

I am using OIDC to allow access between GitHub and AWS. This prevents
the need to use AWS Access Keys which are long-lived credentials which  
are often forgotten about and rarely rotated.

With OIDC, our GitHub workflows can authenticate with AWS using the
[AWS Login Action]. No AWS Access Keys required.
