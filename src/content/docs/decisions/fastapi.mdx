  I chose FastAPI as the web framework.
</Card>

### Decision

- [FastAPI] is becoming one of the most popular frameworks for
  building web applications. Despite being a lot newer than [Django] or
  [Flask], it is reasonably well battle-tested at this point.

- [FastAPI] boasts Go-like performance. I'm not too sure about that.
  However, it is fast enough for our requirements.

- [FastAPI] Has excellent docs.

- [FastAPI] is reasonably lightweight (compared to [Django] at least).

- [FastAPI] comes with a built-in schema endpoint: https://app.y4ni.com/openapi.json

### Consequences

- [FastAPI] is not as lightweight as I would like. I considered using
  [Starlette] which is the framework [FastAPI] is built on top of. However,
  some of the features above were enough to sway me in this case.
