### Decision

- [Python] is considered one of the better languages for prototyping
  and developing solutions quickly. This makes it a pretty good choice  
  for this type of challenge.

- According to some sources, [Python] is one of the fastest growing
  and widely used languages in the world. It has a large community which
  makes it easy to find examples and get help when needed.

- [Python] is human-readable. It was designed to be easy to learn.
  Compared to other programming languages, [Python] code contains much
  fewer symbols which gives it a clean and aesthetically pleasing look.

- [Python] is the language I know best. As such, it is probably the
  best way for me showcase my experience.

### Consequences

- [Python] is pretty slow when compared to other languages. If this
  project were to become more performance-critical, other languages
  may be more suitable.
