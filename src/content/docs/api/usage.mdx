  A feature used to limit API usage.

The API includes a basic usage plan associated with each API Key. This
is used to limit how a particular audience uses the API.

A feature like this can be used to cap usage for different customers
as well as protecting the system from being overloaded. It can also be
used to control cloud costs. In my case, I don't wan't my demo API to
support millions of request per second. Instead, I want to prevent
scaling multiple instances of the API based on lots of concurrent
requests as well as defining a daily quota.

### Quotas & Limits

The API is currently limited to 500 requests per day. It is also
has a concurrency limit of 1.

Exceeding either of the limitations above will result in [429 Too Many Requests]
response:

```json
{
  "message": "Too Many Requests"
}
```
