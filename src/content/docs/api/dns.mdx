  A feature used to host the API under a custom domain name.

As previously stated, the API is hosted at: https://api.y4ni.com
I own the top-level domain and decided to use it for this project.

Using a custom domain name like this provides some benefits. Firstly,
it is usually shorter and easier to remember than the AWS-generated
DNS names for an API Gateway for Load Balancer component. However,
more importantly, it provides an important interface layer between
the client and the underlying infrastructure.

For example, say we were to create a front-end application which
called our API and presented the content nicely. Using the AWS-generated
DNS names makes things a bit awkward. If we needed to change the underlying
infrastructure, the DNS names may change with it. Using a custom DNS
provides more stability and allows teams to evolve the architecture
to meet business needs.
