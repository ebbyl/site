The API includes basic authentication using API Keys. This helps
protect the API by limiting its use to the intended target
audience (you).

By using AWS API Gateway to authenticate requests, we have chosen
to authenticate at the edge or perimeter of our system. This has
some trade-offs.

Firstly, any requests that do not go via the API Gateway will not
be authenticated. For example, say we built another service which
needed to call our API. It probably wouldn't make sense to route
those requests through the API Gateway. However, we may still want
to authenticate them. In this case, our API Gateway solution may
not be sufficient.

On the other hand, performing basic authentication at the perimeter
helps prevent unwanted load on our API servers. If we'd decided to
perform authentication inside our Python application, unauthenticated
requests would travel through our load balancers and into our compute.
This kind of thing could generate lots of additional noise and costs.

Finally, by decoupling the authentication process from our application,
we have made it very easy to reuse across applications written in
other languages and/or running on different types of compute.

## Calling the API

import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="API Key" icon="approve-check-circle">
    An API Key is required for all routes. It is passed as a header:

    ```bash
    curl -H 'x-api-key: <SECRET_KEY>' https://app.y4ni.com/health
    ```

    Will return something like:

    ```json
    {
      "status": "Healthy",
      "version": "demo",
      "uptime": "381.1738233566284"
    }
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="No API Key" icon="warning">
    Requests made without an API Key, such as:

    ```bash
    curl https://app.y4ni.com/health
    ```

    Will return the following:

    ```json
    {
      "message": "Forbidden"
    }
    ```

  </TabItem>
