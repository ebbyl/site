  An app that can run on any compute service

The application used to serve the API is a containerized [Python]
application. For this example, I have chosen to host the workload in
[AWS ECS].

Services like [AWS ECS] and [AWS EKS] are container orchestration tools.
They are ideal for companies running Microservices architectures with
lots of services. They are probably NOT the right choice for the
current project. I chose [AWS ECS] because it is probably the compute
service I have the least amount of experience with. Hence, I saw this
project as an opportunity to sharpen my skills.

This article from Nathan Peck is useful when choosing between AWS
compute offerings.

#### Separation of Concerns

I made a conscious effort to make the source code unaware of the
compute infrastructure it is running on. It should be easy to deploy
to other compute offerings such as [AWS Lambda],
[AWS App Runner], [AWS EKS] or [AWS EC2].

  our [FastAPI] one, on [AWS Lambda].

#### Containerization

Using containerization helps make things portable too. Most compute
offerings support containers. However, there are some downsides.

We're getting pretty good at creating lightweight containers these
days but a container still comes with more than just our application
code. This means we need to scan our images for vulnerabilities and
apply patches when available. This adds some operational burden.

Also, when using [AWS Lambda], you may see performance improvements
when using native archives (zip) instead of containers. However, this
often depends on the runtime being used and the size of the archive.

#### Encapsulation

I have used reusable, self-service, modules to encapsulate most of
the infrastructure details. For example:

```terraform
module "app" {
  source = "git@github.com:ebbyl/tofu-app-ecs.git?ref=main"

  name     = "app"
  image    = local.image
  port     = 8000
  cpu      = 256
  memory   = 512
  replicas = 1

  domain          = "app.y4ni.com"
  certificate_arn = data.aws_acm_certificate.this.arn

  tags = local.tags
}
```

There is really only one line that references [AWS ECS]. My strategy
here is to make it as easy as possible to replace [AWS ECS] with
another compute offering such as [AWS Lambda], [AWS App Runner] or [AWS EKS].
