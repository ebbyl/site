  An app that can run on any compute service

The application used to serve the API is a containerized [Python]
application. For this example, I have chosen to host the workload in
[AWS ECS].

That said, I made a conscious effort to make the source code unaware
of the compute infrastructure it is running on. In other words, it
should be very easy to deploy the app to other compute offering such
as [AWS Lambda], [AWS App Runner], [AWS EKS] or [AWS EC2].

  By using the [Mangum] library, we can deploy Python applications on [AWS
  Lambda].

Services like [AWS ECS] and [AWS EKS] are container orchestration tools.
They are ideal for companies running Microservices architectures with
lots of services. They are probably NOT the right choice for the
current project.

I chose [AWS ECS] because it is probably the compute service I have the
least amount of experience with. Hence, I saw this project as an
opportunity to sharpen my[AWS ECS] skills.
