Welcome to my solution to the DevOps Technical Challenge!

Let's quickly go over the instructions:

import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<Steps>

1. **Fork the [repository](https://github.com/ebbcarbon/devops_coding_challenge)
   into your own Github repository.**

   The fork containing my solution can be found at: https://github.com/ebbyl/app

2. **Develop a very simple RESTful API**

   > 🗣️ _The API should listen on a publicly accessible HTTP endpoint for
   > GET calls at `api/resources` and returns the resources from
   > `data/ebbcarbon.yaml`._

   The API I created is hosted at: https://ebb.y4ni.com/

   See [here](../../reference/example/) for instructions on how to test it!

   <br />

   > 🗣️ _Use whatever language and framework you like - be prepared to
   > tell us why you chose what you did._

   I used [Python] and [FastAPI]. See [Key Decisions] for more on why
   I chose these as well as other design decisions.

3. **Containerize this application**

   I containerized the application using [Docker]. Read more about this
   decision here.

4. **Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to deploy this API onto AWS**

   I used [Terraform] to manage the AWS infrastructure. Well, technically
   speaking I used [OpenTofu] which is an Open Source fork of [Terraform].

   I used [GitHub Actions] to manage the deployment pipeline. You can
   read more about this here.

5. **Create a PR and tag us when you're done**
