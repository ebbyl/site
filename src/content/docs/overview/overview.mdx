Welcome to my solution to the DevOps Technical Challenge!

Let's quickly go over the instructions:

<br />

import { Aside, Card, LinkCard, Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<Steps>

1. #### Fork the base repository

   > _Fork the [Base Repository] into your own GutHub Repository._

   You can checkout the fork I made using the link below.

   <LinkCard
     title="My Fork"
     description="Go to the fork containing my updates"
     href="https://github.com/ebbyl/app"
   />

   <br />

2. #### Develop an API

   > _Develop a very simple RESTful API that listens on a publicly
   > accessible HTTP endpoint for `GET` calls at `api/resource` and
   > returns the `resources` from `data/ebbcarbon.yaml`._
   >
   > _Use whatever language and framework you like - be prepared to
   > tell us why you chose what you did._

   I built the API using [Python] and [FastAPI]. Use the links below
   to explore the API and learn about some of the decisions made
   throughout the development process.

   />

   <br />

3. #### Containerize the application

   I containerized the application using [Docker]. Read more about this
   decision below:

   />

   <br />

4. #### Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

   > _Use the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool of your choice to
   > deploy this API onto AWS. If you don't have an AWS account you
   > can use free tier AWS resources for this test. Be prepared to
   > tell us why you chose what you did._

   I used [Terraform] to manage the AWS infrastructure.

   I used [GitHub Actions] to manage the deployment pipeline.

   Use the links below to learn more about both of these decisions.

5. **Create a PR and tag us when you're done**
