Welcome to my solution to the DevOps Technical Challenge!

Let's quickly go over the instructions:

import { Aside, Card, LinkCard, Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<Steps>

1. #### Fork the base repository

   You can checkout the fork I made using the link below.

   <LinkCard
     title="My Fork"
     description="Go to the fork containing my updates"
     href="https://github.com/ebbyl/app"
   />

   <br />

2. #### Develop a simple API

   I built the API using [Python] and [FastAPI]. Use the links below
   to explore the API and learn about some of the decisions made
   throughout the development process.

   <LinkCard
     title="The API"
     description="Go to API Overview"
     href="../../api/api/"
   />

   <br />

3. #### Containerize the application

   I containerized the application using [Docker].

   I am storing [Docker] build artifacts in [AWS ECR].

   I am using [AWS ECS] for container orchestration. However, I made
   a conscious effort to make the code portable. Use the link below 
   to learn more:

   <LinkCard
     title="Portability"
     description="Learn more about the portability of the app"
     href="../../api/portability/"
   />

   <br />

4. #### Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

   I am using [Terraform]/[OpenTofu] to manage the AWS infrastructure.

   I am using [GitHub Actions] to manage CI/CD workflows.

   <LinkCard
     title="CI/CD"
     description="Go to the CI/CD overview for this project."
     href="../../cicd/cicd/"
   />

   <br />

5. **Create a PR and tag us when you're done**

   <LinkCard
     title="Code Review"
     description="Go to pull request in GitHub"
     href="https://github.com/ebbcarbon/devops_coding_challenge/pull/4"
   />
